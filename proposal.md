## Title of your project
Legonardo DaiVinci

## Team members
 - Gui Suranyi
 - Joe Robertazzi

## Project description
 - The goal of our project is to make a device that prints out images loaded from the computer using 1x1 Lego Tiles. 
   By utilizing a pick and place mechanism, we aim to construct mosiacs resembling scaled-down versions of images. 
   The topics we hope to explore through this project are cartesian machines, stepper motor control, motion interpolation, 
   image processing, and command parsing.

## Hardware, budget
 - 3 Nema17 Stepper Motors
 - 3 Stepper Drivers of 2A
 - Limit Switches
 - Power Supply
 - 1/2 Protoboards
 - Small Vacuum Pump + Suction Cup
 - 6 Lego Baseplates ($10)
 - 2800 Lego 1x1 Tiles ($20)
 - 3D Printed Feeder

 - (All priceless parts will be obtained via independent methods)

 - MangoPi

## Tasks, member responsibilities
 - Joe:
   - Image Processing
   - Bitmap Storing
   - Image to GCode

 - Gui:
   - Stepper Motor Library (GCode to Stepper Motor Motion)
   - Hardware Assembly / Feeders

## Schedule, midpoint milestones
 - Timeline:
   - March 7th - Order Parts
   - March 10th - Image Processing Complete (Max Complete Next Milestone)
   - March 12th - Parts Arrive
   - March 14th - Hardware Complete
   - March 17th - Software Integration Complete

## Resources needed, issues
 - Concerns:
   - Not enough time / all parts unavailable (working on it)
   - Too ambitious? (Probably okay though)
 - Risks: 
   - Time constraint
   - Many moving parts needed to get working
